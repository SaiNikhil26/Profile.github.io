            <h1>College Life</h1>
            <p>
                I joined VIT Chennai in 2021 to pursue my UG in Computer Science Engineering(CSE). With no background of CSE in my schooling, I was confused of what domain in which I can excel. VIT gave me the oppurutnity to discover many domains. In my 2nd semester I started developing interest in Design Domain. I am a part of Design Department in <em>CULTURE IT</em> club at VIT Chennai.
